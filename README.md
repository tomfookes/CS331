DO NOT RUN ALL COMMANDS AT THE SAME TIME!!!
output will be illegible and will probably crash your computer.

It is recommended to comment out everything apart from the commands you wish to run (from the point where it says "Coursework Experiments start here" as the stuff before is definitions used in the rest of the code), and also to run it in the order it is written. You will most likley be able to ignore everything after the comment "This lil bit of code...", as these were not strictly part of the experiments conducted on the network, however they did inform some of the data in the report so i thought it best to keep them in there.
